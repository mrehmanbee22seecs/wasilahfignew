## Tips and Best Practices

### For Better PDFs

1. **Filter Data First**: Export only what you need
   - Smaller PDFs are faster to generate
   - Easier to review and share
   - More focused information

2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Rename downloaded files
   ```
   ✅ Good: active_volunteers_karachi_jan2024.pdf
   ❌ Bad: wasilah_volunteers_2024-02-01.pdf
   ```

3. **Regular Exports**: Generate reports periodically
   - Monthly summaries
   - Quarterly reviews
   - Annual reports

4. **Check Before Sharing**: Review PDFs before sending
   - Verify data accuracy
   - Check for sensitive information
   - Ensure proper formatting

### For Better Certificates

1. **Verify Hours**: Ensure hours are logged before generating
2. **Complete Projects First**: Wait until project completion
3. **Use Appropriate Template**: Match template to occasion
4. **Print Quality**: For physical certificates, print on quality paper
5. **Store Securely**: Keep digital copies for verification

### Performance Tips

- Small exports (<100 records): Instant
- Medium exports (100-1,000): 1-2 seconds
- Large exports (1,000-10,000): 5-10 seconds
- Very large (>10,000): Consider filtering or pagination
